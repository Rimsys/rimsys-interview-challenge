# Rimsys Interview Challenge Overview

## Purpose

This challenge is designed to evaluate how candidates:

* Read and interpret test-driven requirements
* Implement missing pieces without changing test cases
* Debug subtle issues
* Extend a working system with new functionality
* Use modern Laravel (12+) and PHP 8.3+ features confidently

## Challenge Description

You are working on a **Regulatory Document Tracker** application for Rimsys. The app manages:

* **Products** — medical devices

* **Document Types** — enum for types (REGULATORY, TECHNICAL, etc.)

The application is half-implemented, with intentional gaps and issues that you need to fix.

Your task is to make the application work by:

1. Reading the test cases to understand what functionality is expected
2. Implementing the missing pieces
3. Fixing the bugs
4. Adding the missing features

You should not change the test cases. Instead, you should make the application work so that the tests pass.

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

* Code quality and organization
* Understanding of Laravel and PHP features
* Problem-solving approach
* Attention to detail
* Ability to follow requirements
* Use of modern Laravel and PHP features
